            1) map() goes through all element and returns something done. <br>
            2) forEach() approaches each element (if you no need returns). <br>
            3) filter() on the other hand goes through all the elements and returns only those that match the criteria. <br>
            4) find() condition will only go to the first element and not the rest.</p>

          3) Event Loop in JavaScript
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content bg-green-100"> 
          <p class="font-medium">Java Script is a single threaded language. It always runs in synchronous way. That is, after calling a function, another function will execute. If one function calls another function, it will call all of them and then go to the next function. In between these functions if asynchronous calls are made like settimeout, fetch etc. then they are sent to the callback queue from where the event loop goes to the callstack and is called. This is basically the event loop.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content bg-green-100"> 
          <p>The chooseQuiz function takes 2 parameters. Then the find loop is executed on isExists and then it is checked whether it is true or not and 0 is taken as a locator variable. Then a for of loop is executed on each answer. Then if the id of isExist and the id of quiz are equal then answer is spliced and each time the serial is incremented by one. Otherwise the answer is pushed. And from here the answer is sent through DisplayAnswer.</p>
